Now that you have downloaded Ballance game full version, you might be wondering how to play it like a pro. Ballance is not an easy game, and it requires a lot of skill, patience, and strategy to complete all the levels. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you master this game:

- The first tip is to learn how to switch between the different types of balls. You can change your ball's material by rolling over special tiles on the course. There are three types of balls: wood, stone, and paper. Each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, wood is light and fast, but it can be easily blown away by fans or burned by fire. Stone is heavy and slow, but it can break through barriers or activate switches. Paper is very light and can fly with the wind, but it can be torn by sharp objects or water.
- The second tip is to pay attention to the environment and use it to your advantage. The game has various elements that can help or hinder your progress, such as fans, magnets, bridges, cannons, elevators, etc. You have to use them wisely and creatively to overcome the obstacles and reach the end of the level. For example, you can use a fan to blow your paper ball over a gap, or use a magnet to attract your stone ball to a metal platform.
- The third tip is to practice and memorize the layout of each level. Ballance is a game that requires a lot of trial and error, and you will likely die many times before you succeed. However, each time you die, you can learn from your mistakes and improve your strategy. You can also use the checkpoints to save your progress and restart from there if you fail.
