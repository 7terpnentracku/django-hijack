House of Wax follows Carly and her friends as they explore the town and discover that the wax museum is actually made of real people who have been coated with wax by the psychotic twin brothers Bo and Vincent. The brothers are former conjoined twins who were separated by their abusive mother, who runs a gas station nearby. The brothers have been killing travelers and turning them into wax figures for years, and they target Carly and her friends as their next victims.
 
The movie is a loose remake of the 1953 film of the same name, which starred Vincent Price and was itself a remake of the 1933 film Mystery of the Wax Museum. The 2005 version updates the setting to modern times and adds more gore and violence to appeal to the fans of the slasher genre. The movie also features Paris Hilton in her first major film role, which attracted a lot of media attention and criticism.
 
House of Wax received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized its clichÃ©d characters, predictable plot, and excessive brutality. However, some critics praised its production design, special effects, and suspenseful scenes. The movie also performed well at the box office, grossing over $70 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million. The movie has since gained a cult following among horror fans who appreciate its campy style and homage to classic horror films.
