## Option 1: Use the Free Trial Version
 
One of the easiest ways to get Lightroom 6 for free is to use the free trial version available on the official Adobe website. You can download it [here](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/free-trial-download.html) and use it for 7 days without any limitations. This is a great option if you want to test the software before buying it or if you only need it for a short-term project.
 
To use the free trial version, you will need to create an Adobe account and sign in with your Adobe ID. After the trial period expires, you will have to either buy a license or uninstall the software.
 
## Option 2: Use Your Existing License Key
 
If you have already bought a license key for Lightroom 6 in the past, but you lost your installation disk or your computer crashed, you can still download and activate Lightroom 6 using your existing serial number. To do that, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this page](https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/kb/downloaded-older-app.html) and sign in with your Adobe ID.
2. Scroll down to find Lightroom 6 in the list of older apps and click on Download.
3. Select your operating system (Windows or Mac OS) and language.
4. Copy the serial number that appears on the screen and save it somewhere safe.
5. Download the installer file and run it on your computer.
6. Follow the instructions on the screen and enter your serial number when prompted.
7. Enjoy using Lightroom 6!

Note that this option only works if you have a valid license key that you purchased from Adobe or an authorized reseller. If you don't have one, you will have to buy one from another platform (see option 3).
 
## Option 3: Buy a Licensed Disk from Another Platform
 
If you don't have a license key for Lightroom 6 and you don't want to pay for a CC plan, you can still buy a licensed disk from another platform such as Amazon or eBay. However, you should be careful when choosing a seller and make sure that they are trustworthy and offer genuine products. You should also check the reviews and ratings of other buyers and avoid any offers that seem too good to be true.
 
To buy a licensed disk from another platform, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Search for Lightroom 6 on the platform of your choice and compare the prices and conditions of different sellers.
2. Select the seller that offers the best deal and has positive feedback from other buyers.
3. Place your order and pay for it using a secure method.
4. Wait for your disk to arrive and check its authenticity.
5. Install Lightroom 6 on your computer using the disk and enter your serial number when prompted.
6. Enjoy using Lightroom 6!
